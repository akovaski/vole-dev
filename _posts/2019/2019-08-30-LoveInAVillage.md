"Love In A Village" is a piece from _A Select Collection of Scots English Irish and Foreign Airs Jiggs & Marches Vol 1_. I could not find any performances of these songs online, so I decided to create some using [LMMS](https://lmms.io/).

This realization features a flute.

The sheet music can be obtained from [IMSLP](https://imslp.org/wiki/A_Selection_of_Scotch%2C_English%2C_Irish_and_Foreign_Airs_(Aird%2C_James)).

Enjoy.
